"1","2011","Rebecca Smith-Hoffman","rebecca-smith_1.jpg","rebecca-smith_1_thumb.jpg","<p>Each year the Albert Baxter Award is presented at the Annual Meeting and Banquet in May to someone who has contributed to the preservation and interpretation of the history of the Grand River Valley. This year the Board of Trustees honors Rebecca Smith-Hoffman.</p>

<p>Historic Preservation is Rebecca Smith-Hoffman&rsquo;s vocation and avocation. For more than thirty years she has been involved in issues arising out of maintaining the built environment of Grand Rapids and other Michigan communities. She believes that our buildings are what shape us as a community &ndash; they provide people with a necessary sense of place and time. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Her first action to save a building was in the late 1970s when she joined her Heritage Hill neighbors in picketing Calvary Undenominational Church, which was then located on Michigan Street, to protest the destruction of houses for church parking.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
From that time on she has worked with many other dedicated people in the following areas:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Heritage Hill Association</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Zoning and planning issues, helping to stabilize the neighborhood</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;Kent County Council for Historic Preservation</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Saved the Peck Building</li>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Saved Brookby &ndash; the Blodgett mansion</li>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Saved the Berkey and Gay Furniture Factory</li>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Saved the City Hall/County building/Calder Plaza</li>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Worked to combat urban renewal mentality generally&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>South East Economic Development Corporation</strong> (a community-based economic development organization focusing on the redevelopment of Wealthy Street)</p>

<ul>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With Jennifer Metz wrote the Wealthy Street Historic District Study Committee Report leading to the designation of the historic district</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;East Hills Council of Neighbors</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Assisted with the Cherry Hill Historic District Study Committee report leading to the designation of the historic district</li>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Assisted with the Fairmount Square Historic District Study Committee Report leading to the designation of the historic district</li>
</ul>

<p>Rebecca and friend Jennifer Metz formed Past Perfect in 1995. The firm provides consulting services for Historic Preservation Tax Credits, National Register of Historic Place nominations, historic resources surveys, project planning, historic research, and photographic documentation. They are proud to have had the opportunity to participate in the redevelopment of many of the city&rsquo;s historic buildings, both large and small, including the Berkey &amp; Gay Furniture Factory, the American Seating Factory, the Monroe Avenue Water Filtration Plant, the Winchester Building, the Aldrich Building, and many, many more.</p>

<p>Rebecca Smith-Hoffman continues to offer her voice to preservation. She was quoted recently regarding the vandalism issues in the revitalized areas along Wealthy and Cherry Streets and was very vocal in the fight to save the St. Andrew&rsquo;s School building. We will hear from Rebecca for many years to come when a neighborhood or building needs to have someone speak up before it is too late.</p>

"5","2012","Kevin Finney","kevinfinney2.jpg","kevinfinney2_thumbnail.jpg","<p>Kevin Finney, local cultural historian, outdoorsman and scholar, is widely known for his expertise in the life and history of Native Americans from the Great Lakes region.&nbsp; Our community&#39;s awareness of Native American history has been greatly enriched with the work of Finney. He teaches and writes books in the Pottawatomi language, helps kids build authentic birch-bark canoes and bark houses, and develops educational resources focused on Native American culture.</p>

<p>Finney, who lives with his family just north of Hopkins, is hired by schools, museums and historical sites from across the country for his expertise. Since 1998 he has reconstructed dozens of detailed, historically accurate Native American structures at interpretive sites and schools across the Great Lakes region. Many were built with students and the Native American community. He&#39;s also supplied film and television production crews with authentic Native American canoes, bark-covered wigwams, hides, pottery, stone tools and clothing.</p>

<p>Two months of the year, the educator serves as an artist-in-residence at the&nbsp;Goodwillie Environmental School&nbsp;in Forest Hills Public School District, teaching fifth graders local history through hands-on activities and historical research with students. The projects focus on historical mapping, fur trade history, snowshoe making and building a birch-bark canoe similar to those constructed by Native Americans years ago.</p>

<p>In 2009, Finney founded the&nbsp;Great Lakes Lifeways Institute,&nbsp;a non-profit educational organization dedicated to preserving and sharing the heritage of the Great Lakes region&#39;s land, traditions, arts and culture.</p>

<p>In addition to this, Finney conducts numerous community workshops and classes, including Potawatomi language courses for the&nbsp;Gun Lake Band of Pottawatomi Indians, programs at the&nbsp;Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI)&nbsp;at Aquinas College, and the&nbsp;Great Lakes Traditional Arts Gathering.</p>"
"6","2013","The Western Michigan Genealogical Society","WMGS_Baxter_Award_Image_600x450.jpg","WMGS_Baxter_Award_Image_600x450_thumbnail.jpg","<p>&ldquo;The Western Michigan Genealogical Society (WMGS) was founded in 1954 with the purpose of preserving and making available for genealogical research the records of our ancestors; encouraging and assisting members in genealogical research; promoting the exchange of knowledge and encouraging the deposit of genealogical records in established libraries and archives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their area of focus includes Kent County and the counties immediately surrounding; namely Ottawa, Muskegon, Newaygo, Montcalm, Ionia, Barry and Allegan Counties. There is some extension beyond these counties into other areas of the Western Lower Peninsula.</p>

<p>The objectives and purposes for which the Society is organized are:</p>

<p>1. to preserve and make available for genealogical research the records of our ancestors;</p>

<p>2. to encourage and assist members in genealogical research;</p>

<p>3. to promote the exchange of such knowledge;</p>

<p>4. to encourage the deposit of genealogical records in established libraries and archives;</p>

<p>5. to publish a genealogical newsletter, bulletin, or magazine on a quarterly basis.</p>

<p>WMGS has published many books based on research done by members. The latest is <em>STATE LAND PATENTS, KENT COUNTY, MICHIGAN. </em>Originally compiled by Western Michigan Genealogical Society in 1984, this publication was redone and improved in 2010. Original land patents given by the Michigan State Government from approximately 1840-1879 are included. These are very important records, as Kent County had more state land for sale than any other county in lower Michigan at that time. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Their quarterly publication, <em>MICHIGANA</em> specializes in original and unpublished material, concentrating on western Michigan. Bible records, tombstone inscriptions, newspaper excerpts, vital records, family histories, society news and helpful hints are regular features. All members are encouraged to submit material for publication.</p>

"7","2014","Henry & Lokie Boersma","IMG_6415.JPG","IMG_6415_thumbnail.JPG","<p>Henry and Lokie Boersma would stop out at each of the West Michigan libraries, from Grand Haven to Grand Rapids, and drop off each new publication or index they had created. During this time the Boersma&rsquo;s have produced numerous works that either index or document the historical progression of the Western Michigan area, with special focus on Western Kent and Ottawa Counties. In total the Boersma&rsquo;s, since their retirement over 20 years ago, have produced over 27 different indexes and publications. These works range from indexes of the records of Ottawa County Infirmary to the indexes of cemeteries in Missaukee County and the compilation of the obituaries of the Coopersville Observer.</p>

<p>On top of all of this indexing and compiling &nbsp;the Boersma&rsquo;s have also been responsible for the creation and maintenance of the Tallmadge Township archives. For the last twenty years the Boersma&rsquo;s have gained the confidence and trust of the this township and saved the records of this community. They have cataloged every historical record of Tallmadge and saved the materials from being thrown away. With this the Boersma&rsquo;s have become the archivists of this West Michigan town.</p>

<p>With all of this work you would be surprised to find the fingers of the Boersma&rsquo;s in any other historical pursuits. I know I was surprised when I was walking the grounds of the Eastmanville Farm and found the restored Ottawa County Poor Farm Cemetery. I was even more surprised to find that the marker which recognizes all of the participants in the restoration of this Poor Farm, Lokie and Henry were two of the most prominent names. This mainly came from the fact that the Boersma&rsquo;s were the primary researchers into all of the men and women who were buried in this forgotten cemetery. This is only one cemetery in our region that the Boersma&rsquo;s have helped in saving, there are other cemeteries where the work of the Boersma&rsquo;s have preserved the memory of those who are buried.</p>"

"36","2015","Garret Ellison","photo2.jpg","photo2_thumbnail.jpg","<p>To those who move in local history circles in Grand Rapids, Garret Ellison is no stranger.&nbsp; Since 2008, when he began writing for the Grand Rapids Press, and particularly during the last three or four years, Garret has dedicated significant effort to the production of many feature articles published in the Grand Rapids Press, and the MLive on-line version thereof, covering historical events and presenting to the reading public the stories of those in our past who have made and shaped this community.</p>

<p>Born in Grand Rapids in 1982, Garret spent much of his childhood living in Traverse City, before completing his education at Central Michigan University and Northwestern Michigan University, and returning to his hometown in 2008 to write for the Press.&nbsp; His work for the Press has uniformly exhibited a level of wit, humor and erudition that is sadly all too often lacking in contemporary reportage, resulting in his attracting a considerable readership that comfortably relies on his thorough research and thoughtful work product.</p>

<p>Feature articles on many subjects, including the history and changes of Monroe Avenue, and most recently, the story of the &lsquo;urban renewal&rsquo; that swept through Grand Rapids in the 1960s have reacquainted and fascinated thousands of readers about aspects of our history that have come perilously close to slipping from common knowledge.&nbsp; Grand Rapids, and its downtown areas have not always looked and felt the way that they do today, and it has been Garret&rsquo;s prosaic and finely researched pieces that have greatly increased the general familiarity and appreciation of our historical environment, and awakened both a new and renewed interest in local history in thousands of Grand Rapidians. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Most notable among Garret&rsquo;s published articles have been the half-dozen pieces written about, and in support of the Society&rsquo;s cemetery walks.&nbsp; Far more than mere announcements of an event, these articles have presented the history of each site, the highlights of each walk, and most importantly, have advocated successfully for the cultural and historical importance of cemetery studies.&nbsp; Each of these meticulously researched articles, reflecting Garret&rsquo;s clear and passionate interest in our history, has been directly responsible for the huge success of each of the walks, attracting unprecedented crowds, and in the process, fostering a growing awareness by local citizens of the actions and mission of the Society.</p>

She has spent countless hours researching local history topics and furthering the knowledgebase for other local history researchers to call upon. Her indexes, and finding aids, at the Grand Rapids Public Library are used regularly to assist patrons. Many have enjoyed Ruth&rsquo;s presentations on a range of topics including the Women&rsquo;s Temperance Movement during prohibition. Understanding that some of her efforts were while an employee of these groups, she has always shown enthusiasm to go &ldquo;above and beyond&rdquo; her actual duties.</p>"
"38","2017","Thomas R. Dilley","IMG_5941_600.jpg","IMG_5941_600_thumbnail.jpg","<p>Thomas R. Dilley&rsquo;s contribution to local history is profound. He has published several books through Arcadia Press including; Grand Rapids in Vintage Postcards 1890-1940, Grand Rapids Community and Industry, and Grand Rapids in Stereographs 1860-1900. The research regarding each of the images in these books is thorough. The most exceptional of his publications is The Art of Memory: Historic Cemeteries of Grand Rapids, Michigan. This book, published in 2014 by Wayne State University Press, won the Michigan Notable Book Award in 2015.</p>

<p>Tom currently sits on the boards of the Grand Rapids Historical Commission, the Grand Rapids Historical Society and is on the Board of Trustees of the Grand Rapids Public Museum Foundation as well as the museum&rsquo;s Collections Committee. He previously sat on the Grand Rapids Public Library Foundation board. Tom gives presentations throughout the area on local history topics. Hundreds have accompanied him on tours of cemeteries (over 250 on some tours). He has spoken about his postcards and research regarding his collection to volunteers at the Public Museum.</p>

<p>Tom is modest in his acknowledgement in the donation of objects and ephemera to the local library and the museum. In the museum&rsquo;s collection are objects as varied as a flour bag from the Voigt Milling Company to a token from the West Michigan State Fair. The Thomas R. and Debra C. Dilley Historical Collection #364 can be found on the 4th floor of the main library. It contains postcards, trade cards, scrap books, booklets, yearbooks, etc. of local companies and organizations. At present the collection totals 30 boxes, with the finding aid 58 pages long.</p>
