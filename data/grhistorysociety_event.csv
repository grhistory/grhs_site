Grand Rapids MI, 49503","6_Cutler_Home_1891.jpg.jpeg","<p>Over 100 years ago a small group of women and men of vision saw a need for a compassionate place of healing for people suffering from mental illness, a ministry where those whose minds kept them in chains could come and be treated with dignity and respect, and they could find release and healing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We began quietly in the pastures of Cutlerville, and the story now reaches and extends throughout several states. From a garden to the city. From a small group of immigrant people to lives touched in the entire community in all its diversity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In one way, the Pine Rest of today is far removed from the Christian Psychopathic hospital of 1910, but the strong roots established a century ago have provided the foundation necessary for modern mental health care. We&rsquo;re pleased to share that story with you.</p>

Ford Presidential Museum 303 Pearl St. N.W. Grand Rapids MI, 49503","justice.jpg","<p>In the 1960s and 1970s, a new wave of women attorneys began joining the bar in Grand Rapids, paving the way for many who followed. Yet they were not the first female attorneys to practice law in Grand Rapids. In the late 1870s, Elizabeth Eaglesfield, one of the early female graduates of the University of Michigan Law School, hung out her shingle and began advertising for clients. She was followed by Ella Mae Backus, an attorney who became the backbone of the U.S. Attorney&#39;s Office for the Western District of Michigan, and others such as Gale Saunders, who are largely unknown today. Attorney and Grand Valley professor Ruth Stevens will&nbsp;trace the history of the first century of women attorneys in Grand Rapids, bringing to life the stories of these early women attorneys and linking them to the next wave of pioneers who helped shape the Grand Rapids legal community as it is today.</p>

"6","GRHS Program","""The Most Christian Nation in the World"" - Religion in Society on the Civil War Homefront by Father Bob Miller","7:00 pm","Free and Open to the Public. Free Parking","","St Mark's Episcopal Church, 134 Division Ave N, Grand Rapids, MI 49503","0000592.jpg","<p>In 1860, the single most socially influential factor in America was religion and faith. The United States literally was the most Christian nation in the world&rsquo;s history. The great majority of Americans &ndash; both North and South - approached the issues surrounding the Civil War thru the lens of their faith, religion and specific cultures. Faith defined many aspects of American culture:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Immigrants &ldquo;link&rdquo; to &ldquo;home&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Education and schooling&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Basic source of societal information<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The pervasive values for all of America</p>

<p>Religion had already been crucial to America&rsquo;s founding, and helped the country slowly move apart since the Revolution. Now on the eve of Civil War, differing sectional approaches to Faith and the Bible further split the county socially, politically, theologically and (ultimately) irretrievably. The impact of religion would continue well after the War as well &ndash; as African Americans moved into an uncertain future, and as a new &ldquo;civil&rdquo; religion began to replace traditional pre-war fervor.</p>

<p>Join Father Robert Miller as we look at American culture on the eve of war thru the prism of the Faith of two different families, and their differing cultures, economies, backgrounds, belief systems. These families &ndash; one from Michigan (German evangelical Presbyterian), and one from Mississippi (Southern Baptist) - capture well the painfully transforming issue which the Civil War became in American history.</p>

<p><strong>The Passenger Pigeon</strong> (<em>Ectopistes migratorius</em>) is estimated to have soared through the skies at 60 miles per hour in flocks of millions as early as 1600.</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">Pigeons were estimated to number between 3 and 5 billion, and estimated 40% of the total bird population in North America, during the 19th century. Yet human exploitation plunged this species into extinction over the course of just a few decades. Not to be confused with a Carrier Pigeon or the well-known Messenger Pigeon, we are talking about the gregarious Passenger Pigeon which lived and nested in enormous migratory flocks and became extinct in 1914.</span></p>

<p>Did Grand Rapids play a role in its demise? Come and find out more from Cindy Laug about this amazing species as she explores how and why it went from billions to none in such a short span of time.</p>

<p>At the dawn of the twentieth century, Grand Rapids was in a period of rapid growth. &nbsp;New commercial, manufacturing, and civic buildings helped meet the demands of an expanding community and economy. The existing Federal Courthouse and Post Office was no longer large enough to handle the increasing load.</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">So in 1909, construction began on a new courthouse and post office building &ndash; on the same site as the old building. In 1912, the building that became known as the Old Federal Building was completed and opened for business. For over 100 years, this building has served a range of functions, adaptively modified to retain its character while serving new audiences. In 2013, it began its service as a place for higher education in art and design for Ferris State University and Kendall College of Art and Design. Come and hear from the design architects of this transformation about the journey to make this a reality.</span></p>","canceledfederalbuildingtowoodbridgenferrisbuildingrenewalandreconnection","2015-1-8"

sponsored by&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.ggrwhc.org"" target=""_blank"">Greater Grand Rapids Women&rsquo;s History Council</a></p>

<p>Despite having lost her sight as an infant, Roberta Griffith led an extraordinary life on national, state, and local levels. Griffith, born in 1870, was ten years older than Helen Keller. Working together on more than one occasion, they travelled the nation with others, seeking to improve services for the blind. Griffith had graduated from Case Western Reserve University and embarked on a career in journalism before moving to Grand Rapids, where she then began a new career as a real estate agent at the same time she developed her own version of a braille system and produced a dictionary for the blind. Never her losing her determination to learn, create, and help others, Griffith founded the Association for Blind and Visually Impaired in Grand Rapids in 1913. She served as its executive secretary until her death in 1941, for almost thirty years.</p>

<p>Former city historian Gordon Olson will review the life and work of this extraordinary local woman, including her many innovative programs for the blind and visually impaired. He will be joined by Rick Stevens, current executive director of Association for the Blind and Visually Impaired&nbsp;(ABVI), which celebrated its centennial anniversary in 2013. Stevens will update us on Griffith&rsquo;s legacy to Grand Rapids, today&rsquo;s programs and services of the Association for the Blind and Visually Impaired.</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">In 1907 five African American women&rsquo;s groups hosted the convention of the State Federation of Colored Women&rsquo;s Clubs in Grand Rapids. Delegates from all over Michigan were welcomed by the mayor and treated to trolley tours and receptions. Who were these enterprising women representing a miniscule percentage of the city&rsquo;s population? Only now are we piecing together their story from the rich social ferment fostering the emergence of women onto the nation&rsquo;s public stage. Among the host clubs in 1907 was a new group for younger women, the still-continuing Grand Rapids Study Club.</span></p>

<p>During the 1890s women&rsquo;s clubs had proliferated so rapidly and organized women into such a social force that newspapers were compelled to create new sections featuring their plans and activities. What can be found in these early news accounts? That Jewish women, Polish Catholic women, all women, were gathering for self-education and charitable purposes--and sometimes to step up publicly and denounce racist articles, as did the Married Ladies Nineteenth Century Club in 1898. The Grand Rapids Study Club and the Greater Grand Rapids Women&rsquo;s History Council will tell a fascinating story that fills major gaps at the same time it corrects errors in Grand Rapids history.</p>","robertagriffithvisionary","2015-2-12"

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">&ldquo;<strong>The Jewel In Our Midst&rdquo;</strong> &mdash; <em>A Review by Thomas R. Dilley</em></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is disturbing to admit, as one of its tens of thousands of graduates, that the arrival of the centenary of Grand Rapids Community College, came as a surprise to me. &nbsp;Yes, it had always been there, and I know hundreds of people whose adult lives and careers began in its classrooms. &nbsp;But, like many others, I had never really given it much thought, either about what it has become or how it has impacted our community.</p>

<p>All of that changed with the reading of Walter Lockwood&rsquo;s superb history of the College, Open Door: Grand Rapids Junior/Community College 1914-2014, released in November 2014. &nbsp;The book is everything that GRCC (or GRJC, if you attended when I did) deserves in the year of the 100th anniversary of its founding, and it is everything one could hope for in a history of this remarkable institution.</p>

<p>From Lockwood&rsquo;s capable and experienced hands, the history and accomplishment of the many who created, fostered and defended the College are delivered and (perhaps for the first time) critically analyzed in thoughtful, welcoming prose that is refreshingly distant from the usual self-aggrandizing reportage filling the pages of the countless corporate and college histories on the shelves of unread libraries. &nbsp;This is a college history that deserves to be read, and will enlighten many about the processes that, from its earliest days have made Grand Rapids Community College one of the most consistently vibrant elements of the Western Michigan community. &nbsp;That, together with a vast array of carefully captioned photographs spanning the entire history of the College, would be enough to secure for this book its just place in local and regional history. &nbsp;But, there is more.</p>

<p>In the telling of the GRJC/GRCC story, Lockwood has also included a useful recitation of the history and politics of local education during the past century. &nbsp;Names and stories that might have drifted away are brought back into the light they deserve. &nbsp;Jesse Davis, Arthur Andrews and Richard Calkins, relentless promoters of the College; Benjamin Beukema and Jay Pylman, progressive Superintendents; and even legendary coaches John Bos and Gordon Hunsberger are all discussed and credited for their roles in the century-long history of the College. &nbsp;All of this results in a history not only of the College, but of the educational system in which it was fostered, grew and ultimately triumphed.</p>

<p>This book, written, designed, created and edited within the College, should be acquired and read by the thousands of the College&rsquo;s (like me, sometimes unappreciative) graduates, and especially by all those who may think of it all as &ldquo;just JC&rdquo;. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Actually, there are two jewels in this story. &nbsp;One obviously is the College itself. &nbsp;The other is this book, a great and worthy edition to the history of our city and region.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On September 19, 1933, downtown Grand Rapids was the scene of a gala parade in support of the NRA, the National Recovery Administration, one of FDR&rsquo;s newly created, &ldquo;alphabet soup&rdquo; federal agencies and its codes of conduct for participating businesses. &nbsp;The NRA&rsquo;s symbol, the Blue Eagle, was paraded through the downtown streets in front of 75,000 spectators, accompanied by 75 elaborate floats, the Furniture City Bank and a drum and bugle corps. &nbsp;Many of these floats were sponsored by well-known, local businesses such as American Seating, Corduroy Tire &amp; Rubber Company, Wurzburg Dry Goods and Voight Milling Company. &nbsp;Notwithstanding its federal theme, the &ldquo;Blue Eagle March&rdquo; was a local extravaganza celebrating Grand Rapids manufacturing and commerce.</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">The next day, the power of these local businesses, especially the furniture companies that made Grand Rapids famous in the previous century, was arrayed against the Simmons Company and its Wall Street allies in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan for the first day of trial in an action for an accounting and the recovery of monies alleged by the court-appointed receiver to have been looted from the Berkey &amp; Gay Furniture Company by its corporate owner, the Simmons Company. &nbsp;In September, 1929, just one month before the Stock Market Crash and the onset of the Great Depression, Simmons acquired Berkey &amp; Gay and, in the first dark years of the economic collapse, allegedly liquidated assets for Simmons&rsquo; exclusive benefit to the detriment of Berkey &amp; Gay&rsquo;s creditors, especially its bondholders, who were in large part local Grand Rapids citizens and businesses. &nbsp;The trial was to last for 20 days, staggered over many months. &nbsp;The trial saw local business magnates testify against Simmons. &nbsp;Leading the legal teams of the corporate receiver, the Michigan Trust Company, and Simmons, were perhaps the two brightest stars on the West Michigan legal firmament, Julius H. Amberg and Stuart E. Knappen. &nbsp;While Amberg produced testimony and other evidence on the predatory takeover and buccaneer-type behavior of Simmons, Knappen countered with arguments that, due to Berkey &amp; Gay&rsquo;s troubled financial condition and the impact of the Great Depression, it had no chance of surviving the harsh economic gales.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>At the close of the trial, Federal District Judge Fred M. Raymond entered judgment against Simmons and awarded the receiver a sum in excess of $2,365,000 plus costs and interest calculated at 5% per annum. &nbsp;Both parties then appealed to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals from this judgment and, during the appeals pendency, both the receiver and Simmons settled the case. &nbsp;The furniture companies and local citizenry of Grand Rapids looked back with pride upon the stellar performance of Julius Amberg at trial and with scorn on the predatory practices of Simmons, which was given its just deserts by Judge Raymond.</p>

<p>The East Hills neighborhood has a unique history that adds to its current vibrant character. &nbsp;It has however, taken a lot of hard work and citizen involvement to regain some of the character that the neighborhood possessed in its early beginnings. &nbsp;The majority of the East Hills neighborhood was built in the late 19th Century, when it was made up of orchards and farms. &nbsp;During the late 1800s, the city of Grand Rapids experienced the effects of the industrial revolution and massive immigration of Europeans. &nbsp;Many of these different ethnic groups settled in the East Hills area of the city because it was accessible due to the streetcar. &nbsp;These walkable communities connected the residents to schools, churches, commercial needs, industrial, and transit. &nbsp;Development occurred along transit routes at the time in form of the streetcar, which went along Cherry Street, Eastern Avenue, Lake Drive, Wealthy Street, and Union Avenue making it easy for the residents to travel downtown or to Reeds Lake. &nbsp;From 1870 to 1920 the population of Grand Rapids grew from 16,507 to 137,634. &nbsp;The local businesses began to grow along with the neighborhoods and offered goods to fulfill the immediate needs of the residents. &nbsp;For many years the neighborhood served its residents and was considered a safe neighborhood for families.</p>

<p>During the 1960&rsquo;s East Hills went from being a thriving active community to a neighborhood filled with blight, crime, and abandonment. &nbsp;This was quite a different picture than that of its early beginnings, as the area was left for neglect as residents headed for the newly created suburbs. &nbsp;Along with the Urban Renewal demolitions that occurred in the downtown area during the 1960s and 1970s, the face of inner city neighborhoods in Grand Rapids drastically changed for the worse. &nbsp;Public transit, which was for many years a popular choice of travel, also experienced huge cutbacks due to the affordability of the automobile. &nbsp;Rather than facing these issues head-on, many people continued to leave to the suburbs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the absence of homeowners, large amounts of housing were bought up by slumlords. &nbsp;Long term businesses also left the area for the suburbs leaving buildings vacant with boarded up storefronts for illicit activity to occur. Drugs and gangs became prevalent in the area and long term neighbors began to feel angry and determined to regain their community. &nbsp;It is often said that the best way to unite a group of people is to find a common enemy or target. &nbsp;In the 1980s, the nonprofit organization East Hills Council of Neighbors was formed to face the common enemies and take back the neighborhood that they once loved. &nbsp;The involvement of a few concerned residents became a sustainable neighborhood association that has changed the fate of East Hills.</p>

<p>The vision of the East Hills Council of Neighbors is to provide guidance, assistance, direction, and information in the areas of housing, public safety, education, local economic development and community development for the people who live, own property, and work in the East Hills neighborhood.</p>

<p>Since 2004, East Hills has experienced tremendous growth as new shops, restaurants, breweries, bars, and coffee shops have opened within its three business districts of East Fulton, East Hills, and Wealthy Street. In addition, housing is in great demand. Single family houses in East Hills, on average, are sold within one week of being listed for sale. The rental market in East Hills is highly competitive. Over the next two years, eighty-one new market-rate living units are proposed to be added to our neighborhood along the Cherry Street and Wealthy Street corridors. Foot traffic and bicycle traffic along all of our streets increase 100% every year. The Rapid bus covers the East Hills area with five routes: Route 4, 5, 6, 14, and 19. The streets in East Hills are not just busy with people on weekends; it&rsquo;s every day of the year, regardless of the weather.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The presentation from Rachel Lee will focus on the history of development of the three business districts within the East Hills neighborhood. Rachel Lee is a long-term resident and volunteer in the East Hills neighborhood since 2000. Rachel has led multiple projects related to community economic development and green infrastructure to benefit the neighborhood. She currently serves on the City of Grand Rapids, Bicycle Safety Education Steering Committee and the Strengthening Neighborhoods Task Force; the Neighborhood Coalition and Good Neighbor Committee. She has served as the Co-Chair of the East Hills Council of Neighbors from 2012-August 2013, President of the East Hills Business Association from 2006-2010, Board of Directors for the Wealthy Street Business Alliance from 2003-2010, Chairwoman of the Uptown Advisory Council from 2007-2009, Board of Directors for the East Hills Council of Neighbors from 2001-2003, and a member of the Local Planning Committee for the Michigan Historic Preservation Network in 2009. Rachel received a 2013 Special Recognition Award from City of Grand Rapids Historic Preservation Commission and she was a Woman of East Hills honoree in 2010 and a Logie Award Nominee for the 2009 Neighborhood Business Alliance Awards. She has wrote and partnered on numerous grants bringing a total of $600,000 in funds for projects in the East Hills and Uptown area. She has her B.S. from Grand Valley State University, School of Public, Nonprofit and Health Administration. Rachel is passionate about: local history and historic preservation; urban planning and placemaking; supporting local businesses; parks, public spaces and walkable-bicycle-friendly neighborhoods; Mid-Century Modern and Vintage Design; community emergency management and infrastructure planning; and urban living with her two sons Logan and Lyon Lee, her heart and soul.&nbsp;</p>","easthillspastpresentandfuture","2016-1-14"
"25","GRHS Program","Community Builders: Early African American Women in Grand Rapids","7:00 PM","FREE Open to the Public","","","NWHPclubwomen_600.jpg","<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">Presented by Yvonne Sims, Grand Rapids Study Club and Jo Ellyn Clarey, GRSC &amp; the Greater Grand Rapids Women&#39;s History Council</span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">In 1907 five local African American women&rsquo;s groups hosted the annual convention of the State Federation of Colored Women&rsquo;s Clubs. Delegates were welcomed by the Grand Rapids mayor and treated to gracious receptions and trolley tours. Who were these women hosts representing a miniscule percentage of the city&rsquo;s population? Only now are we pulling together their story from a rich social context that fostered the emergence of diverse local women onto the public stage.</span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">During the 1890s women&rsquo;s clubs proliferated so rapidly and organized women into such a social force that newspapers were compelled to create new sections featuring their plans and activities. What can be found in these early news accounts? That Jewish women, Polish Catholic women, all women, were gathering for self-education and charitable purposes&mdash;and sometimes to step up publicly to denounce racist articles, as did the Married Ladies Nineteenth Century Club in 1898.</span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">The Grand Rapids Study Club and Greater Grand Rapids Women&rsquo;s History Council will tell a fascinating story that fills major gaps at the same time it corrects errors in Grand Rapids history.</span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">photo courtesy: Library of Congress&nbsp;#womenshistory: &nbsp;<em>During the 19th century women were often secluded within the home, so they formed clubs. These groups were not just social however, they were also formed around political or betterment causes. Common topics discussed by the women in these groups included finding solutions around health, sanitation, education, and suffrage. Club members often organized lectures and other community events.</em></span></p>

<p>The Grand Rapids Chicks (1943-1954) were a women&#39;s professional baseball team that thrilled local fans with&nbsp;outstanding play in the late 1940s and early 1950s. They were part of a World War II-era experiment to&nbsp;insure that fans had games to watch and teams to cheer for. At the time the thinking was that President Franklin Roosevelt might cancel the&nbsp;1944 major league baseball season because it was not essential to the war effort. As it turned out, the major&nbsp;league season did continue. The All American Girls Professional Baseball League also prospered before succumbing in 1954 to television, competition from other sports, and bad management.</p>

<p>At 75 feet, basepaths were shorter, and pitchers initially threw underhand or sidearm, but in all&nbsp;other aspects, the game was baseball, and local fans responded enthusiastically to their team. In one&nbsp;instance, a crowd of 10,000 turned out for a championship game at South High field, where the Chicks&nbsp;played most of their home games. Always a strong team, the Chicks won the league championship in&nbsp;1947 and 1953.</p>

<p>The best player on the Chicks team was Connie Wisniewski, a tall, right-handed, former softball</p>

<p>pitcher who won 27 games in her rookie season, a record 32 games in her best year, and still holds many other&nbsp;league pitching records. When league rules were changed to permit overhanded pitching, Wisniewski&nbsp;became a .300 hitting outfielder for the remainder of her career.</p>

<p>After the league folded, several of the Chicks made their homes in Grand Rapids. Today older&nbsp;fans remember their exploits and flock to see them at public appearances. A new generation of young&nbsp;women also comes, seeking to meet the trailblazers who helped prepare the way for succeeding&nbsp;generations of women athletes.</p>

Moreover, it will review the roles of area women in the massive social movements surrounding the years 1920 - 1933.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;Spirited Women: Grand Rapids and the Push for Temperance, GGRWHC board members Ruth Van Stee and Julie Tabberer will illustrate how the histories of both the &ldquo;True Woman&rdquo; of the nineteenth century and the &ldquo;New Woman&rdquo; of the Jazz Age contributed to the long foreground of Grand Rapids as &ldquo;Beer City USA.&rdquo; And these women have complicated stories! For example, one surprise may be that the first alcohol to be purchased in Kent County, following the repeal of Prohibition, was made by a feminist activist involved in prohibition reform and Michigan temperance education. On December 30, 1933, Dorothy Smith McAllister bought the first bottle of champagne to celebrate a new year and new life after the failed social experiment. Michigan was, in fact, the first state to vote for the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment.</p>

<p>Ruth Van Stee will report on why women had invested so heavily in prohibition in the first place. Grand Rapids citizens was seriously involved in the century-long efforts--both men and women--as they pushed temperance as a solution to the social ills often resulting from the misuse of alcohol. When women often could not control their own wages or inheritances, when they were largely dependent on men for their well-being--men who had the legal right to drink away family resources--the links between the Eighteenth Century Temperance Movements and the Nineteenth Century Women&#39;s Rights Movements are no surprise.</p>

<p>Immediately following the formation in 1874 of the Woman&rsquo;s Christian Temperance Union, the Michigan chapter was founded in Grand Rapids. Summer headquarters for the national group was hosted by the Bay View Association, north of Petoskey, which made Michigan a magnet for over 90 women speakers, many of whom stopped over in Grand Rapids. Our city and state had indeed experimented with temperance reform long before the Eighteenth Amendment was passed in 1920.</p>

<p>Julie Tabberer will focus on Grand Rapids during the Roaring Twenties of speakeasies and bathtub gin, when expanding radio and advertising media popularized the notion of the &ldquo;flapper.&rdquo; She will illustrate where and how easily single young women moving to the city could spend their own money and flout the law of the land, helping to enrich area rum runners. Despite the seeming freedoms of Jazz Age parties, however, the 1920s became a period of backlash to advances made by women during the turn-of-the-century Progressive Era. Still, the actions of irresponsible young women overlapped with those of a woman enforcing the law through the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office in Grand Rapids. Her name was Ella Mae Backus. (See&nbsp;<a href=""http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs136/1102964307953/archive/1116698178390.html"" target=""_blank"">2014 newsletter article about her</a>)</p>

<p>Prohibition proved a disastrous legal experiment, but its social effects were long-standing. Alcohol consumption remained down until the 1970s, and certification of the 19th Amendment had already guaranteed universal suffrage. Women who had been laboring for their full rights as citizens for over a century continued the effort in Grand Rapids and in the nation.</p>

<p><strong style=""line-height: 1.6;"">Shattering Glass Ceilings &ndash; Women&rsquo;s Elective History in Grand Rapids, 1888&ndash;2015</strong></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">p</span><span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">resenter: <strong>Deirdre Toeller-Novak</strong></span></p>

<p>Between 1888 and 2015, Harriet Cook, Eva McCall Hamilton, Grace Ames Van Hoesen, Evangeline Lamberts, and Rosalynn Bliss each shattered another of the glass ceilings impeding the full participation of women in the process of governing our schools, the city, county, and the State of Michigan. Their stories are laced with perseverance in the face of scorn, personal sacrifice, fraud, and high adventure. On March 30, these women&rsquo;s stories will form the backdrop of a presentation that points to the importance of having an accurate record of women&rsquo;s elective history and how it has shaped our community in 2016. We will also look at its significance to women in their personal and professional lives. &nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">Through years of effort on the part of the Greater Grand Rapids Women&rsquo;s History Council, Grand Rapids is one of a few, if not the only, American city to have a complete history of women running for and elected to office since the opportunity was first extended to them. This unique set of data proves that Grand Rapids women ran for office beginning in 1888&mdash;much earlier than had been known, in fact, decades before second-wave feminists believed that they were running for the first time. Women in the mid-to-late 19th&nbsp;century were among the earliest to vigorously push the national movement toward suffrage even while lobbying from outside of the established system for changes in education and government. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">In her summary of the first 50 years of the League of Women Voters of Grand Rapids, Dorothy Leonard Judd wrote that in its beginning the League had &ldquo;one immediate and overriding purpose: to awaken the nation&rsquo;s women to their new responsibilities as voting citizens and to their new opportunities to work for legislation on social problems proverbially neglected by men (The First Fifty Years, League of Women Voters of Grand Rapids). Through the stories of women who were first to be elected to their respective offices, we will examine the remarkable strategies and accomplishments of trailblazers whose work is far from complete. Their methodologies provide valuable tools in today&rsquo;s political arena which continues to be dominated by a struggle for justice between groups of disparate economic, social, and cultural&nbsp;backgrounds. Please join us on Wednesday, March 30.&nbsp;&#8203;</span></p>

<p>Deirdre Toeller-Novak&nbsp;is proofing a compilation of Grand Rapids women&rsquo;s elective history, in whose pages she can be found. Her election to the boards of the Grand Rapids Public Schools and Grand Rapids Community College in the 1980s places her in the line of women elected to local school boards begun in 1888. She will share data from the Greater Grand Rapids Women&rsquo;s History Council&rsquo;s unique electoral history and illustrate its importance in 2016. Deirdre&rsquo;s historical and political efforts overlap in work promoting involvement of women in the elective process and consequent systemic change. Her professional career was directed by her early training in criminal justice and legal systems, including the leadership of municipal and non-profit organizations such as district court probation departments, the Grand Rapids Bar Association, and the Children&rsquo;s Assessment Center. In retirement she stretched her experience to include a master&rsquo;s degree in English Literature.</p>","shatteringglassceilingswomenselectivehistoryingrandrapids18882015","2016-3-30"

Oral histories record these stories, highlighting the role a person played in the broader community. Over time, some stories are buried or forgotten. Oral histories can speak to these gaps, bringing new information to light and changing the story going forward. But what exactly are oral histories, where do you find them, and how do you use them? Using film and audio clips, historian and archivist Jennifer Morrison will discuss what oral histories are and what they can tell us.

<p><strong>WACs, WASPs, SPARs, and Marines: &nbsp;Nicknames, Recruiting, and the Wartime Experience of Servicewomen from Grand Rapids</strong><br />
by&nbsp;Will Miner</p>

<p>The Greater Grand Rapids Women&rsquo;s History Council is pleased to provide the November 10, 2016 program of the Grand Rapids Historical Society&mdash;just two days after the historic 2016 presidential election and one day before Veterans Day. Honoring the latter, the Grand Rapids Public Library&rsquo;s Will Miner will highlight the WWII experiences of local women Marines to illustrate the first large-scale employment of women in the United States armed forces.</p>

<p>Having committed their entire societies to the Second World War effort, warring nations lost fifty to eighty million people while tens of millions more were wounded or taken ill. Such losses led both Allied and Axis nations to employ more women than ever before as workers, nurses, clericals, and auxiliaries. Some countries also used women in combat roles.</p>

<p>Early on, geographical location allowed the U.S. to resist the idea of women in the military, so American women were invited into military roles relatively late. The argument of proponents of women&rsquo;s service&mdash;that having women fill non-combat jobs allowed more men into combat units&mdash;prevailed in early 1942, near the peak of Axis success when the cost to the Allies was very high. Initially, the armed services were unwelcoming, but women were first accepted by the Army, later the Navy and Coast Guard, and finally the Marine Corps.</p>

<p>Using their portrayals in the media, how women were recruited and trained, and even the nicknames they were given,&nbsp;Miner will illustrate women&rsquo;s struggles for acceptance. Though their integration continues to the present, the Second World War can be viewed historically as when women were finally accepted into the armed services of the United States.</p>

<p>This presentation will highlight the record of struggle in Grand Rapids and examine how, though being&nbsp;the most resistant of all the forces, the Marine Corps ultimately became the most progressive branch of the armed services in its acceptance of women.</p>

<p>Please join us on&nbsp;November 10&nbsp;when Will Miner will use local press reports, oral histories, and historical photographs to illustrate the experiences of area women as they challenged popular opinion and military tradition for the opportunity to defend their country.</p>

<p>Will Miner served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1992 to 1996 and is currently a library assistant in the archives of the Grand Rapids Public Library. A 2003 graduate of GVSU, he earned a Masters in Library and Information Science from Wayne State in 2013.</p>

<strong>Present, But Not Counted: Dutch Immigrant Midwives in Grand Rapids</strong><br />
<em>Janet Sjaarda Sheeres</em></p>

<p>Though stories of male physicians are common in medical histories, accounts of female midwives have been neglected. What histories of early American immigrants ever ask, &ldquo;Who delivered the babies?&rdquo; Adding to her body of work on invisible Dutch women, Sheeres has uncovered ten midwives working in late 19th and early 20th century Grand Rapids, and thirty more in other Dutch communities. She will address why these women chose work delivering babies, who their clients were, what hardships they faced, and why they are not in our histories. Sheers&rsquo; findings also shed light on midwives serving other ethnic communities and why they have been sidelined in early historical records.</p>

<strong>Selling Grand Rapids: Expositions in the Furniture City, 1878 &ndash; 1965</strong><br />
<em>Scott St. Louis</em></p>

<p>Grand Rapids&rsquo; late 19th-century business leaders were ambitious and optimistic. As railroads connected the city with an emerging consumer base, they took advantage of this network to expand furniture production. Local leaders established semi-annual furniture expositions and collaborated to make Grand Rapids&rsquo; name synonymous with excellent household furniture on an international scale. With the help of a supportive community, leaders resolved to prevent similar efforts in other cities from eclipsing their own. Their success transformed the physical and economic landscape of Grand Rapids.</p>

<strong>Making Waves: Michigan&rsquo;s Boat Building Industry, 1865-2000</strong><br />
<em>Scott M. Peters</em></p>

<p>Michigan&rsquo;s late 19th-century emergence as the boat-building industry&rsquo;s hub drew together talented designers, builders, and engine makers to produce some of the fastest, most innovative boats ever created. Entrepreneurs like Christopher Columbus Smith, John L. Hacker, and Gar Wood established some of the nation&rsquo;s top brands and brought the prospect of boat ownership within reach for every American consumer. Michigan boat builders also left their mark on history&mdash;from developing the speedy runabouts favored by Prohibition-era rum-runners to creating the landing craft that carried Allied forces to Europe and the Pacific. Making Waves explores the story of an industry that evolved in Michigan but would change boating across the world.</p>

<strong>Where Have All the Flowers Gone? Rediscovering Emma Cole&rsquo;s 19th-Century Grand Rapids Flora</strong><br />
<em>Julie Stivers, Garrett E. Crow, and David P. Warners</em></p>

<p>In 1901, Emma Cole published Grand Rapids Flora, a catalog of plants growing without cultivation in the vicinity of Kent County. Enormous changes have taken place since those days, yet her book remains the most complete account of plants specific to our area. Who was this high school teacher, world traveler and Kent Scientific Institute botanist? Where were her favorite spots for wildflowers? Do they still exist?

<strong>A Modern Vision Realized: The Mid-Century Park School Development Program</strong><br />
<em>Pam VanderPloeg</em></p>

<p>In 1951, a successful Grand Rapids Public Schools millage vote launched a twenty-year building program to solve the crisis of aging, overcrowded schools and the post-World War II baby boom. A collaboration between the schools, prominent West Michigan architects and the Grand Rapids Park Department, led by landscape architect Fred See, created beautiful modern schools set in expansive parks in old and new neighborhoods and brought national recognition. The story of how that project unfolded, and of the fate of those schools today, will be told through original and contemporary photos and images.</p>

<p>Who were the Blodgetts, and what did they do? &nbsp;And what&rsquo;s the story behind that palatial estate in East Grand Rapids people refer to as the Blodgett Estate? &nbsp;Briefly find the answers to these questions as we look at the person of John W. Blodgett and the palatial home he and his wife built, which still stands as a testament to an era from the last days of Downton Abbey, Gatsby, and the Roaring 20&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The affluent and wealthy citizens of Grand Rapids once lived in the neighborhoods we know today as Heritage Hill and Cherry Hill. &nbsp;And the 400 block of E. Fulton was once lined with magnificent homes and impeccable lawns and gardens. &nbsp;Eventually these residents pushed further into the country, and many built country homes around the areas of Reeds Lake and Fisk Lake, in East Grand Rapids. &nbsp; The 1920&rsquo;s saw a boom of construction around this area, with craftsmanship and hand-detailed work rarely seen today without a computerized machine. &nbsp;Among these country homes, one estate was built which was more aristocratic, more stately, and was better known than all the rest. &nbsp;This was the estate of Brookby. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s owners were John W. and Minnie C. Blodgett.</p>

<p>Today in the 21st century, most citizens really don&rsquo;t know the Blodgett family. &nbsp;The family that lived here has all passed away, and the grandchildren and great-grandchildren are spread across the country. &nbsp;However, 100 years ago the Blodgett name summoned visions of, not only great wealth, but of civic leadership and philanthropy. &nbsp;Along with the Waters, the Lowes, the Bissells, and other similar families, the Blodgett&rsquo;s were among the top leaders in the greater Grand Rapids area, but their influence was felt across the country.</p>

<p>The Blodgett&rsquo;s were a lumber family. &nbsp;They were lumber barons in an era when Captains of Industry still existed. &nbsp;Along with Michigan, the Blodgett&rsquo;s owned and controlled millions of acres across the country, including Missouri, California, Oregon, and into Canada. &nbsp;Started by D.A. Blodgett, the family patriarch, the family business expanded under the leadership of his son John W. Sr., who eventually would be succeeded by his son, John W. Jr, (Jack). &nbsp;The Blodgett&rsquo;s harvested millions of acres of lumber, much of which was used in construction of bridges, homes, and furniture. &nbsp;The biggest client of the Blodgett&rsquo;s was the U.S. Government, who bought back the harvested land for reforestation purposes. &nbsp;</p>

<p>John Blodgett expanded the family business and made a vast fortune, building upon the fortune he inherited from his father. &nbsp;However, he also was very involved in the community, giving behind the scenes far more than he gave publically. &nbsp;Still, he did give publically. &nbsp;He donated the money for Blodgettt hospital in honor of his mother Jane. &nbsp;His wife was a supporter of Camp Blodgett, the children&rsquo;s camp on Lake Michigan. &nbsp;And they also supported the D.A. Blodgett Children&rsquo;s Home, funded by, and named after, his father. &nbsp;During the Great Depression, John personally saved 3 banks from failing. &nbsp;He was also served a term on the Federal Reserve Board in Chicago, and was heavily influential in Republican politics for his entire life.</p>

<p>As a legacy to their success, (which seems pretentious today, but was the norm in an era where society and class levels existed and mattered), the Blodgett&rsquo;s built Brookby. &nbsp;This 41 room mansion sat on 8 acres, and also had three other cottages on the grounds for the Gardener, Chauffer, and Gatekeeper. &nbsp;It also had an 8-stall heated garage with plumbing, and its grounds were done by the prestigious firm the Olmsted Brothers. &nbsp;It was designed by the New York architectural firm Walker &amp; Gillette, who did many Gold Coast homes along Long Island. &nbsp;When an event of the Blodgett&rsquo;s occurred in the Society pages, it simply would state it happened at &ldquo;Brookby House.&rdquo; &nbsp;When mail was sent to the Blodgett&rsquo;s, it was simply marked &ldquo;John Blodgett, Brookby House, East Grand Rapids, MI.&rdquo; &nbsp;Today, the Blodgett&rsquo;s exist only in memory, in yellowed newspapers and micro-film, in black and white photos, and as names on buildings. &nbsp;But Brookby still stands proudly, albiet silently. &nbsp;A testament to the success of a family who once conquered Michigan&rsquo;s greatest industry in the era before the automobile. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the summer of 1862, the Union was in dire peril. The second year of the Civil War brought changes to the nature of the war and the fabric of the country. Confederate forces were seemingly unstoppable, having won a string of unanswered victories. Now Confederate armies were invading Maryland and Kentucky. Anti-war sentiment grew in response to President Abraham Lincoln&#39;s issuance of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. The two pronged invasion of Kentucky threatened to bring Confederate forces all the way from Middle Tennessee to the Ohio River. The fall of Louisville and or Cincinnati seemed imminent.</p>

<p>In response to this emergency, Lincoln called for 600,000 volunteers. Raw recruits from Illinois, Indiana and Ohio were rushed to the front to protect the Ohio River line. Major General Horatio Wright, the Department commander, was organizing the defenses of Cincinnati. Major General William &ldquo;Bull&rdquo; Nelson was given the task of defending Louisville.</p>

<p>Nelson was a native Kentuckian and a career navy officer who was commissioned a general in the U.S. Army as a reward for his role in keeping Kentucky in the Union. He was a large man, with a fierce temper, which he was quick to unleash on anyone who ran afoul of him. As a general, he had won a number of small victories. His division was first to occupy Nashville after the fall of Fort Donelson, and his troops were first on the field to support U.S. Grant on the first day of the battle of Shiloh. Nelson was trying to organize the raw recruits into something resembling an army.</p>

<p>Brigadier General Jefferson C. Davis was a native Indianan, and also a career army man. He won distinction in the Mexican War and was commissioned directly into the army after that conflict. He was small in stature, but had an ego and a temper that matched Nelson&#39;s. He was appointed to assist Nelson at Louisville and tasked with organizing the new forces into regiments and brigades, a job he felt was beneath him.</p>

<p>When Nelson confronted Davis about his lack of progress, he lost his temper and the two men engaged in a shouting match. Nelson ordered Davis to leave the city. A week later, Davis returned, provoked a confrontation and shot Nelson to death. Although he was arrested and indicted, he was never brought to trial. A number of factors contributed to this astonishing result, including political intrigue, cronyism and the exigencies of war.</p>

<p>Imagine we are walking through an old part of your town, the oldest part of town.&nbsp; Now imagine we discover a building that has been sealed up for over a century.&nbsp; A building that was closed up before the Civil War began.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s go inside and take a look.&nbsp; The interior of this building has remained untouched by human hands for decades and is filled with tools and utensils of the day.&nbsp; Imagine what we could learn from these priceless artifacts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How many buildings like this actually exist in the world today?&nbsp; Probably very few, if any.&nbsp; Yet, here in Michigan, we are surrounded by something just as valuable.&nbsp; Undiscovered shipwrecks.&nbsp; These underwater time capsules are loaded with implements and personal belongings of our ancestors, preserved by cold, deep, dark water.</p>

<p>Lake Michigan is home to over one thousand reported shipwrecks.&nbsp; More of these shipwrecks have been found on the lake bottom in the past decade, then any other decade in history.&nbsp; Some say this is the golden age of Great Lakes shipwreck hunting.&nbsp; Advancements in technologies such as sonar and GPS mapping have demystified much of the lake bottom.&nbsp; Diving technology has improved also, with divers reaching depths of 300&rsquo; plus regularly.&nbsp; Improvements in underwater cameras allow divers to reveal these wrecks to the public in impressive fashion.</p>

<p>As a general rule of thumb, the deeper the shipwreck, the better state of preservation that shipwreck will be in.&nbsp; Lake Michigan boasts some of the most intact and well preserved shipwrecks on the planet.&nbsp; One of these amazingly preserved shipwrecks lies on the bottom of Northern Lake Michigan near Sleeping Bear Dune and the Manitou Islands.&nbsp; In December of 1854 the 200&rsquo; wooden passenger steamer Westmoreland foundered in a winter gale.&nbsp; 17 of her crew and passengers perished, but 17 survived, and soon rumors of gold coins in her safe and whiskey barrels in her hold started circulating around the Great Lakes.&nbsp; Over the next 150 years, the Westmoreland would become one of the most sought after shipwrecks on the lakes with nearly twenty expeditions launched to find her.</p>

"49","GRHS Program","Speedrome Gone, But Not Forgotten","7:00 PM","FREE and Open to the Public","","111 Library St NE, Grand Rapids MI 49503-3268","","<p>On this evening Doug Taylor will focus on the history around C.C. Comstock and his connection to the birth of the West Michigan Fairgrounds, Comstock Park and eventually the Historic Speedrome. &nbsp;&nbsp;It was located on North Park St. between the Grand River and West River Dr. in Comstock Park, MI. Woodland Paving and US-131 Expressway occupy the property today.</p>

<p>Taylor will take you on a parade of chronological events as they happened in the very early years of the Historic West Michigan Fairgrounds. Along the way Doug will bring to life the days of the thundering race cars that roared around the track since 1903, with names like Barney Oldfield, Louis Chevrolet and Ralph DePalma. Then he will focus on reasons the State Fair after 45 years left for Detroit and why the grounds fell into disuse.</p>

<p>In 1946 after World War II ended, the nations craze turned to airplanes, because so many were involved with aircraft during the war. Visionary O. C. Hall gambled on a fifty year lease with an option to purchase the fairgrounds and built a north-south runway with a seaplane base on the river. Doug goes on to explain much of the operations of Grand Rapids Air Park that was short lived, including an Air Service owned by the famous Amway founders, that failed horribly.</p>

<p>In 1949 O.C. Hall rebuilt the grandstands as work was started on a multi-purpose racing facility with modern conveniences close in to Grand Rapids. Plans included building a half mile dirt racetrack with a fifth mile dirt track inside it. On May 28, 1950 the Speedrome as it was called, opened with 10,000 fans to watch midgets race on the fifth mile track. The big cars were postponed until the next Sunday, do to the Grand River flooding the half mile track.</p>

<p>The Speedrome went through a bunch of difficult management and lease periods through the first 5 years of operation. Doug then looks at the big power struggle enveloped between Berlin Raceway (seven miles to the west) and the Speedrome in 1951, for the cars and drivers from the area, as both tracks run on Saturday night. Speedrome had a half mile race track and brought in Nascar in 1951 and 1954 for a couple of 200 lap races. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moving into the late 1950s, the track was promoted by Frank Evans and Flip Kamp, who brought in Joey Chitwood Thrill Show drivers regularly, had many midget races, jalopies and on occasion would have powder-puff races and wreck-om derby&#39;s.</p>

<p>Halfway into 1963 season Chet Hall, (O.C. Halls son) &nbsp;become the last promoter and in 1964, he paved the half mile track, put lights on it and brought in the Super Fast Modifieds, with wide open competition. As a bonus they added the fast Semi Late Model Stock Cars and the crowds grew to epic proportions, which ended in being the high point of the Speedrome, the low point being the sale of the Speedrome on August 1, 1966 to the State of Michigan for the extension of US-131 north from Grand Rapids I-96.</p>

<p>Come join Doug and Speedrome drivers, Johnny Benson Sr., Wayne Landon, Gail Cobb, Bob Senneker and Ralph Baker to tell their stories and share memories of that by gone era and join them in a Question &amp; Answer secession at the end of the presentation.</p>

Greater Grand Rapids Women&rsquo;s History Council</p>

<p>Thursday, November 9, 2017, 7:00pm<br />
Ryerson Auditorium, Grand Rapids Public Library</p>

<p>Co-sponsored by the <a href=""http://www.ggrwhc.org/"" target=""_blank"">Greater Grand Rapids Women&rsquo;s History Council</a>, the <a href="""" target=""_blank"">Grand Rapids Historical Society</a>, &amp; the <a href=""http://www.grpl.org/"" target=""_blank"">Grand Rapids Public Library</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her title honoring a new book examining World War I&rsquo;s &ldquo;surprising impact on women and, in turn, women&rsquo;s impact on the war,&rdquo; Melissa Fox&rsquo;s presentation will introduce the second line of defense in Grand Rapids a hundred years ago. Local and academic historians are only beginning to tell the stories of American women as citizens during the largest wartime mobilization of a young country, dispelling myths that women led lives only in their homes. When invited in because of military needs, diverse groups of women made contributions to the nation that ranged far beyond the war and their traditional gender roles. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In the same way that a century ago Grand Rapids women tailored their knowledge and talents to suit the war effort, local women&rsquo;s historians are currently learning how their own work on the reform movements of community foremothers needs to be extended and reinvested in the larger context. When American women were granted a federal mandate by the Council of National Defense, when the government established the CND&rsquo;s Woman&rsquo;s Committee in Washington, woman&rsquo;s committees were also formed on state and local levels all over the nation. That this history has been so long neglected remains astonishing.</p>

<p>On November 9th Melissa Fox, the new president of the Greater Grand Rapids Women&rsquo;s History Council, will provide an overview of recent work bringing this period to life. Leading with the local, she will illustrate how hundreds of American women&#39;s groups transformed their organizational structures upon U.S. entry into World War I. They addressed the nation&rsquo;s failure to assess serious health problems that suddenly compromised national security when huge percentages of American men failed their military physicals. Long-time efforts to establish exercise on playgrounds for children, to get fresh food into the city through farmers markets and school gardens, and to find employment for women in factories and business took off.</p>

<p>Highlighting examples of Grand Rapids women serving on state- and city-level woman&rsquo;s committees, Fox will share some familiar names of women activists in new positions. On the state level, educator Josephine Ahnefeldt Goss was the chair of &ldquo;propaganda,&rdquo; in charge of convincing recent immigrants that they, too, should participate in food programs benefitting their children as well as the war effort.</p>

<p>As contemporary local researchers are hailing the historical efforts of women, they are also studying public pressures levied by Hoover&rsquo;s Food Administration to force them to sign food pledges and register for war work. Still, as a result of the registration campaign, during one week of May 1918 over half the female adult population of Grand Rapids completed what we celebrate today as the most comprehensive census of women&rsquo;s life at the time. You will be hearing more about this over the next year!</p>

<p>The wartime efforts of pioneering Grand Rapids, midwestern, and national women&rsquo;s leaders have been too long neglected. Even professional women&rsquo;s historians have not until recently understood the scale of accomplishment. Join us on November 9th for a look at history-making in process--to see how in a new century nineteenth-century women&rsquo;s efforts were newly understood, energized, and reframed by an invitation from the federal government. And see where it led&mdash;for starters, to universal suffrage, the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920.</p>

<p>The Grand Rapids local history community originally met Melissa Fox when she worked in the Local History and Special Collections Department of the Grand Rapids Public Library and served as coordinator of History Detectives programming. Currently, she bridges life as a freelance writer, researcher and homemaker with life in her new role as president of the Greater Grand Rapids Women&rsquo;s History Council. Women activists and volunteers from a hundred years ago would recognize her juggling act!</p>

<p>During 2018 the GGRWHC will celebrate thirty years of existence and register afresh how past women&rsquo;s experiences relate to present and to future goals. Among the Council&#39;s first projects were research workshops and a conference, which showed off how much had been uncovered in the early years. Soon city-wide celebrations called Legacy involved dozens of local organizations, representing the arts, education, health care, business, labor, and religion, to help uncover data and &nbsp;highlight what had already been found.</p>

<p>For nearly thirty years the Council has recruited and trained researchers, encouraged donations to local archives, distributed bibliographies on area women&rsquo;s history, digitized materials for broader dissemination, and developed creative programming to spread information about the early accomplishments of female scientists, attorneys, journalists, even reformed courtesans. Five years ago at a quarter century, it took stock and published a brief summary history, which you can find on its website:&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.ggrwhc.org/our-history"">http://www.ggrwhc.org/our-history</a></p>

<p>Heritage Hill has a long history. It was an early site of what might be thought of as &ldquo;country houses&rdquo; outside of the Grand River flood plain. Of course, the designation&mdash;&ldquo;heritage hill&rdquo;&mdash;was only applied at the time of its official designation as a protected historic district. Its boundaries include areas developed over at least 6 decades: large numbers of structures appeared from the 1880s through the 1920s. A few were built as early as the 1840s, and as recently as the 2010s.</p>

<p>The preservation movement was a national phenomenon, spurred on by the &ldquo;Urban Renewal&rdquo; program funded by the federal government in the 1960s. Physical deterioration and urban patterns which did not accommodate the automobile comfortably led to massive demolition of urban fabric and creation of more open (and often &ldquo;dead&rdquo;) urban spaces. Plans to extend this approach from the commercial and civic downtown area to the elegant residential area on &ldquo;the Hill,&rdquo; led to the preservation movement, which succeeded in historic designation around 1970.</p>

<p>While &ldquo;preservation&rdquo; is the goal, the theme of the presentation is the constant change that has characterized the Heritage Hill district over its history. Both before and since it gained &ldquo;protected&rdquo; status, there has been continuous change: increased density of buildings; additions to single-family homes; construction of duplexes and multi-family structures next to older buildings; conversion of single to multi-family use; adding &ldquo;style&rdquo; to simple vernacular buildings; in-fill development; re-conversion to fewer units per building&mdash;it has never stopped.</p>

<p>Influenced by its geography, surveyors and land sub-divisions, changing housing styles and esthetics, national economic cycles and world wars, the district presents a fascinating tapestry of life. The people who were important in it contributed significantly to the life of the larger community, through public offices held, professions practiced, and non-profit organizations founded and projects pursued.</p>

<p>Long-time resident and author of two books on Heritage Hill, Tom Logan will give examples of all of this, illustrating why he loves his neighborhood.</p>

<p>Historian Diana Barrett will share the story of the Women&rsquo;s Defense Cards, the research they inspired, and new information that has been discovered beyond Grand Rapids.</p>

<p>During the week of April 27 through May 4, 1918, twenty thousand Grand Rapids women, half the city&rsquo;s female population, registered for the war effort. One thousand registrars were trained to conduct a twenty-to-thirty-minute interview with each woman. Her information was recorded on a 5 x 8 card, designed and printed in Washington DC and used nationally. Unlike the male WWI registration cards, those from the women&rsquo;s nationwide registration are a data-rich resource.</p>

<p>The men&rsquo;s cards were saved; the women&rsquo;s cards disappeared. Grand Rapids, however, had discovered a collection of 20,000 cards housed in the Library&rsquo;s attic. Since that time, due to excellent research by genealogists and other interested researchers, many new sources of cards, and new information has been discovered beyond Grand Rapids and Michigan.</p>

<p>Diana Barrett has been a member of the Grand Rapids Historical Commission since 2001, and from 2009-2011 served as its chair. Barrett also has been responsible for the Commission&rsquo;s websites. For her work on the websites, and research regarding the Woman&rsquo;s Committee WWI cards archived at the Grand Rapids Public Library, Barrett has earned the Albert Baxter Award for local history in Grand Rapids and a Historical Society of Michigan State Award in Communications. She is currently working on a book about former Grand Rapids Mayor George Welsh.</p>

<p><strong>The Wives, and Lives, of Early Dutch Pastors</strong><br />
by Janet Sjaarda Sheeres</p>

<p><strong>Ryerson Auditorium, Grand Rapids Public Library</strong><br />
Downtown Grand Rapids, Michigan</p>

<p><strong>FREE and Open to the Public<br />
No Ticket Necessary</strong></p>

<p>Grand Rapids, take note! Not only do early women citizens have a history, but the stories of early pastors&rsquo; wives are also riveting. When Janet Sjaarda Sheeres was editing a 700-page tome on early synod minutes of the Christian Reformed Church (1857-1880), she realized that she had waded into an all-male world, where women&rsquo;s concerns were seldom considered and their stories never recorded.</p>

<p>A popular speaker, Sheeres has been in the business of making seemingly ordinary women remarkable. Their stories&nbsp;virtually always sidelined in early historical records, she brings them to life for us.&nbsp;From lists of births, Sheeres has illustrated the lives of early Dutch midwives; from shipping indexes, created pictures of single women immigrants crossing the Atlantic on their own. Now she has turned her attention to a group of women whom no one else has thought to consider. The biographies of early male ministers have been well documented. Rescuing their wives from obscurity in her new book,&nbsp;&ldquo;For Better For Worse. Stories of the Wives of Early Pastors of the Christian Reformed Church&rdquo;, Sheeres proves they were important community builders in their own right&nbsp;and highlights their living conditions and the challenges they faced. Reclaiming the stories of wives of early clergy, Sheeres&rsquo; slides will also make visible aspects of their lives and give us another angle on nineteenth-century area history.</p>

<p>After her program Sheeres&rsquo; books will be available for sale as will an early 2018 special issue of Origins magazine focusing on women&rsquo;s history! Be inspired to expand her project into the broader community!</p>

<p><strong>Janet Sjaarda Sheeres Bio</strong><br />
Born in the Netherlands, Sheeres speaks fluent Dutch and is the author of four books and over 70 articles in national and international journals on Dutch emigration/immigration history. Among her many service positions, she has been president of the Association for the Advancement of Dutch American Studies, chair of the Christian Reformed Church Historical Committee, and is the current editor of Origins, the historical magazine of Calvin College&rsquo;s Heritage Hall Archives</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Art-Memory-Historic-Cemeteries-Michigan/dp/0814340199"" target=""_blank""><strong>Greater Grand Rapids Women&rsquo;s History Council</strong></a><br />
During 2018 the Greater Grand Rapids Women&rsquo;s History Council has celebrated thirty years of existence recruiting and training researchers, encouraging donations to local archives, distributing bibliographies on area women&rsquo;s history, digitizing materials for broader dissemination, and developing creative programming to spread information about the early accomplishments of female scientists, politicians, journalists, even reformed courtesans. Five years ago at a quarter century, it took stock and published a brief summary history, which you can find on its website: &nbsp;<a href=""http://www.ggrwhc.org/our-history"" target=""_blank"">http://www.ggrwhc.org/our-history</a></p>

<p>Join the GGRWHC on November 8, 2018, after the program when we will offer materials and conversation describing our broader efforts to locate and share local women&rsquo;s history.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Absent from existing histories, these Dutch immigrant women lived lives marked by hardship and loss, labor and fortitude, birth and death. By focusing on the experience of women, Sheeres adds another dimension to our understanding of the history of the Christian Reformed Church&mdash;one in which masculine ambition, human foibles, congregational squabbles, and the sacrificial labor of women take center stage and challenge us to rethink the origins of the Christian Reformed Church in America.&rdquo;<br />
&mdash; Kristin Kobes Du Mez, History Department, Calvin College &amp; GGRWHC Board Member</p>

<p>&ldquo;These fascinating, assiduously researched profiles of the first ten Christian Reformed ministers&#39; wives provide new insights on the denomination&#39;s early existence, its tight social networks, both internally and with the Reformed Church in America, and the conditions these women met and sacrificially endured. Their stories need to be told and deserve our sober appreciation.&rdquo;<br />
